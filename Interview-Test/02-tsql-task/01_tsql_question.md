# T-SQL and MSSQL exercises


## Theoretical Exercises
1. What is the purpose of SET NOCOUNT ON in a stored procedure? How does it affect performance and client-side applications.?

2. How would you handle a performance bottleneck where a .NET application frequently calls a stored procedure that joins 8+ tables and shows inconsistent execution times?

3. A .NET application is using connection pooling with SQL Server. Under heavy load, you observe connection timeouts and deadlocks. How do you diagnose and resolve this issue?

4. You observe that a .NET Core application sometimes gets “timeout expired” errors when calling a stored procedure, but running the same SP directly in SSMS completes in <2 seconds. How do you approach this issue?

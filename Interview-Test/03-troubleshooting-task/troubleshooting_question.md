# Section 4 Troubleshooting
This section assesses your ability to diagnose and resolve issues, as well as your practical experience in software development 

## Questions

1. Your ASP.NET Core Web API application, which connects to an MSSQL database, suddenly starts returning HTTP 500 Internal Server Error for all data retrieval endpoints. The application was working fine an hour ago, and no code changes were deployed. What steps would you take to diagnose and resolve this issue?

2. A user reports that a specific report in your .NET application is taking an unusually long time to load, sometimes timing out. This report involves complex queries to multiple tables in MSSQL. How would you approach identifying the bottlenecks and improving the reportâ€™s performance?

3. You are working on a .NET application that uses Entity Framework Core. After deploying anew feature, you notice that some database operations are causing deadlocks. How would you identify the cause of these deadlocks and what strategies would you employ to prevent them?

4. A .NET application that processes messages from a queue occasionally crashes with an OutOfMemoryException. The application is designed to handle a high volume of messages. What are the potential causes for this exception, and how would you investigate and resolve it?

5. During a .NET framework to .Net Migration, you encounter an issue where a third-party library, which was critical for a specific business logic, is not compatible with .NET 8. The vendor has no plans for a .NET 8 compatible version. What are your options, and how would you proceed?

6. How do you ensure the quality and maintainability of the code your write? Discuss your approach to Unit testing, code reviews, and adherence to coding standards.

# Section 1 .NET Theoretical and Coding Exercise 

## Theoretical Exercises
This section assesses your understanding of the challenges and best practices involived in migrating applications from the .NET framework to .NET. 

1. What are the most significant challenges you would expect to face when migrating a large, m,monolithic ASP.NET MVC application from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 8? Please describe at least three challenges and explain how you would mitigate them?

2. Explain the role of the .NET Upgrade Assistance. What are its limitations, and when would you choose to use it versus a manual migration approach?

3. Describe the key difference between the project file format (.csproj) in .NET Framework and .NET. What are the advantages of the new SDK-style project format?

4. Your team is migrating a .NET framework application that heavily relies on WCF for communication with other services. What are the recommended alternatives to WCF in the .NET ecosystem, and what factors would you consider when choosing a replacement?

5. How would you handle third-party dependencies that are not compatible with .NET during a migration? Describe a step-by-step process for identifying and resolving such dependencies.

### .NET Exercises

6. Explain the concept of async and await in C#. Provide a simple code
example demonstrating their use and explain the benefits of asynchronous
programming in a typical web application context.

7. Describe the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern and its benefits. How is DI typically implemented in ASP.NET core application? Provide a conceptual code example demonstrating it.

8. What is LINQ (Language Integrated Query)? Provide a C# code example that uses LINQ to perform a complex query on collection (e.g., filtering, sorting, and grouping)

9. Discuss the differences between IEnumerable<T>, ICollection<T>, IList<T>, and List<T> in C#. When would you choose one over the others.

## Coding Exercises

1. You are tasked with building a simple RESTful API endpoint in ASP.NET Core that manages a collection of Product objects. Each Product has an Id (int), Name (string), Price (decimal) and Stock (int). Implement the following: 
    - A Product model class.  
    - A simple in-memory data store (e.g., List<Product>) 
    - An API endpoint (GET /api/products) that returns all products. 
    - An API endpoint (GET /api/products/{id}) that returns a single product by its ID. 
    - An API endpoint (POST /api/products) that adds a new product. Ensure that the Id is unique and generated by system (e.g., incrementing integer) 
    - An API endpoint (PUT /api/products/{id}) that updates an existing product. Return a 404 of the product is not found.
    - An API endpoint (DELETE /api/products/{id}) that deletes a product. Return 404 if the product is not found. 

2. Create a .NET console application that simulates a basic Order processing system 
    - Define a class Order with properties OrderId (int), CustomerName (string), TotalAmount(decimal), IsProcessed(bool, default false)
    - Store a list of orders in memory. 
    - Write a method ProcessOrderAsync() that simulates order processing with a 2-second delay per order (use Task.Delay). After processing, IsProcessed = true
    - In Main(), print all the unprocessed orders, call processOrderAsync, and print all processed orders once done. 

3. Build a feature in the HR web application to display a list of employees 
    - whose salary is RM4,000 and above. 
    - the salary threshold should be a parameter from the web app.
    - Ensure the SQL database connection is ready.
    - Use the tables provided in coding questions _Interview-Test/02-tsql-task/create_database_table.sql_

4. You are given a basic ASP.NET MVC Web Application for managing stock. The system should allow:
    - Listing all products
    - Adding a new product
    - Updating stock
However, the code has errors (compile-time + runtime). Find out and fix them.

# Section 2 .NET Theoretical and Coding Exercise 

## Coding Exercise

1. You are tasked with building a simple RESTful API endpoint in ASP.NET Core that manages a collection of Product objects. Each Product has an Id (int), Name (string), Price (decimal) and Stock (int). Implement the following: 
    - A Product model class.  
    - A simple in-memory data store (e.g., List<Product>) 
    - An API endpoint (GET /api/products) that returns all products. 
    - An API endpoint (GET /api/products/{id}) that returns a single product by its ID. 
    - An API endpoint (POST /api/products) that adds a new product. Ensure that the Id is unique and generated by system (e.g., incrementing integer) 
    - An API endpoint (PUT /api/products/{id}) that updates an existing product. Return a 404 of the product is not found.
    - An API endpoint (DELETE /api/products/{id}) that deletes a product. Return 404 if the product is not found. 

2. Create a .NET console application that simulates a basic Order processing system 
    - Define a class Order with properties OrderId (int), CustomerName (string), TotalAmount(decimal), IsProcessed(bool, default false)
    - Store a list of orders in memory. 
    - Write a method ProcessOrderAsync() that simulates order processing with a 2-second delay per order (use Task.Delay). After processing, IsProcessed = true
    - In Main(), print all the unprocessed orders, call processOrderAsync, and print all processed orders once done. 

3. Build a feature in the HR web application to display a list of employees 
    - whose salary is RM4,000 and above. 
    - the salary threshold should be a parameter from the web app.
    - Ensure the SQL database connection is ready.
    - Use the tables provided in coding questions _Interview-Test/02-tsql-task/create_database_table.sql_
